# BT : (Adaptive) Boosting Tree for Tweedie distributed response variable.

## Aknowledgements

The author has been theoretically supported by Detralytics' Scientific Directors Julien Trufin and Michel Denuit.

The idea behind (A)BT is similar to the one developed in the `gbm3` package, originally written by Greg Ridgeway <greg.ridgeway@gmail.com>.
This package is inspired by the latter and some of the developed codes are then pretty similar.

## References

This package is based on the original idea proposed by Detralytics' Scientific Directors Julien Trufin and Michel Denuit.
